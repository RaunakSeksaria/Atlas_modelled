# Exploratory Data Analysis on a modelled graph
## ATLAS game as the model for a Grpah
The graph is made by modelling cities/countries, etc as nodes, and if you could go from city A to city B in the ATLAS game, there will be a directed edge from node A to node B


This is the inital work done as a part of the Graph task for Dual Degree MS Student application for Lab Precog @ IIIT Hyderabad
The report are the notebooks themselves.  
initial idea was to do everything in 1 notebook, but found it easier to make different notebooks for countries, cities, and combined
